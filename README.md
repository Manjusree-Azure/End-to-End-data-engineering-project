# End-to-End-data-engineering-project
End to end Dataengineering project from On-premise SQL table to powerBI analysis

This project demonstrates an end-to-end Azure data engineering solution, starting from a local SQL database and culminating in Power BI reporting, all automated.

Thanks to [Mr. K Talks Tech](https://www.youtube.com/@mr.ktalkstech) for the project inspiration.

## Business Objective

This project serves as a learning opportunity for common data engineering practices, focusing on ETL pipeline techniques. The skills sharpened here are valuable for small to medium-sized businesses aiming to migrate their local data to the cloud.
